        2. selector is function that you will call, "itemDroppedOnCharacter:" 
            : means one or more parameters. If colon is not there, it will look for function with no parameters.
            and NSNotifications pass in a Notification object pareameter, must have colon or function will not be called.
            This is a common mistake when learning iOS.
        3. "onTargetDropped" is the name of the notificaiton, named before in DragImg class
        4. No object, nil.
